## Overview

TMDB Library is a straightforward website where I fetch information from [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) and display it on the screen for users. This was only the third website page I'd ever built. The first two were what got me accepted into General Assembly. All things considered, I'm proud of how it turned out, if only because it was my first attempt at integrating an API into a project.
